# Shadows in the Browser

This is a (limited) Javascript implementation of the shadows library.

## Install

Node is required to install dependencies:
```

```

Then compile the Javascript:
```
npx rollup --config
```

Finally, open `index.html` in your browser of choice to play. The AI models are
loaded from a server.
